    * **Python**: Lots of options built on Tornado
    * **PHP**: Erm... ReactPHP... Ratchet
    * **Ruby**: Faye
    * *Language agnostic*: most hosted services

    ## Native Mobile Support?
    
    * Only some have mobile clients
    * How much data are you sending?
    * SSL required on 3/4G networks
    * HTTP fallback required?

    ## 4. Understand your App's Functionality
    
    * Information Architecture a.k.a Data
    * Interaction Complexity:
      * How users interact with your app
      * Client <-> Server interactions
    * Understand the framework functionality you need...
    
    ???
    
    * Going back to the 4 data paradigms:
    * Do you want a few simple streams of data - onMessage
    * Are there multiple streams where the app chops and changes the information it wants - PubSub
    * Do you need bi-directional communication?
    * Are you effectively manipulating a share data structure - sync
    * Or are you trying to provide access to server functionality in a more elegant way - RMI

    ---
    
    template: lblue
    class: left-content
    
    ## onMessage
    
    ```js
    // client
    
    var sock = new SockJS( 'http://localhost:9999/sockjs' );
    
    sock.onmessage = function( e ) {
      console.log( 'message', e.data );
    };
    ```
    
    ```js
    // server
    
    sock.write( 'hello SockJS' );
    ```
    
    ---
    
    template: lblue
    class: left-content
    
    ## PubSub
    
    ```js
    // client
    
    var client = new FayeClient();
    
    client.subscribe( 'fwdjs-tweets', function( tweet ) {
      // Handle Update
    } );
    ```
    
    ```js
    // server
    
    var tweet = {
      text: '#ForwardJS rocks!',
      user_name: '@leggetter'
    }
    Faye.publish( 'fwdjs-tweets', tweet );
    ```
    
    ---
    
    template: lblue
    class: left-content
    
    ## Evented PubSub
  
    ```js
    // client
    
    var pusher = new Pusher( APP_KEY );
    
    var channel = pusher.subscribe( 'fwdjs-tweets' );
    
    channel.bind( 'new_tweet', function( tweet ) {
      // Handle Update
    } );
    
    channel.bind( 'tweet_updated', function( tweet ) {} );
    
    channel.bind( 'tweet_deleted', function( tweet ) {} );
    ```
    
    ```js
    // server
    
    var tweet = {
      text: '#ForwardJS rocks!',
      user_name: '@leggetter'
    }
    pusher.trigger( 'fwdjs-tweets', 'new_tweet', tweet );
    ```
    
    ---
    
    template: lblue
    class: left-content
    
    ## Data Sync
    
    ```js
    var myDataRef = new Firebase('https://yo.firebaseio.com/');
    
    myDataRef.push( {name: '@leggetter', text: 'Yo!'} );
    
    myDataRef.on( 'child_added', function(snapshot) {
      // Data added
    });
    
    myDataRef.on( 'child_changed', function(snapshot) {
      // Data has changed
    });
    
    myDataRef.on( 'child_removed', function(snapshot) {
      // Data removed
    });
    ```
    
    ???
    
    * Manipulating collection of data
    * Not dealing with Messages

    template: lblue
    class: left-content
    
    ## RMI
    
    ```js
    // client
    
    $.connection.hub.start(); // async
    
    var chat = $.connection.chatHub;
    
    chat.client.broadcastMessage = function (name, message) {
      // handle message
    };
    
    chat.server.send( 'me', 'hello world' );
    ```
    
    ```csharp
    // server
    
    public class ChatHub : Hub
    {
      public void Send(string name, string message)
      {
        // Call the broadcastMessage method to update clients.
        Clients.All.broadcastMessage(name, message);
      }
    }
    ```

    * SockJS - focus on simple connections
    * Some solutions offer PubSub and data sync
    * Dropbox - offer simple DataStore API
    * Only know a few RMI options
    * New solutions: Meteor, DerbyJS, SailsJS - maybe a new category for these?

    * How to integrate:
      * Self-hosted
      * Hosted

    background-image: url(/img/realtime-web-stack-tight-integration-self-hosted.png)
    
    ### Self Hosted <small>(Tightly Coupled)</small>
    
    
    ???

    * Less initial overhead - quick Integration
    * As project grows complexity increases
    * Updating request/response cycle may impact realtime functionality and vise-versa
    * Likely that the web server is handling load of both standard HTTP and realtime i.e. WebSocket, Server-Sent Events, HTTP fallbacks

    template: lblue
    class: bottom
    background-image: url(img/realtime-web-stack-integration-self-hosted.png)
    
    ### Self Hosted <small>(Loosely Coupled)</small>
    
    ???
      
    * Generally agreed that a loosely coupled architecture is going to be easier to change and maintain
    * Your DB may even be message-queue-capable e.g. Redis.
    * So you simply need to hook your realtime server into that
    * Web App for HTTP
    * Realtime for realtime functionality
    * Scale-out realtime server in the same way as web server

    template: lblue
    class: fill-img
    
    ### Hosted
    
    ![](../img/realtime-web-stack-integration-hosted.png)
    
    ???
    
    * Load-balancing connections
    * Maintaining state of connections
    * Synchronising data between nodes
    * Mapping connections to users?
    * Dedicated hosted service will offer :
    * Make things easier and faster  
    * Reduce scaling complexities
    * Natural loose coupling via an API
    * Where is your value?
    * Features v Infrastructure

    # You are just starting out

    ### Realtime Framework
        
    * Meteor & hosted offering
    * SailsJS
    * SocketStream
    
    ### BaaS (Back-end as a Service)
    
    * Firebase
    * Simperium
    
    See: http://nobackend.org/
        
    ???
    
    * A Framework where you can self-host
    * Or hosted service: a BaaS where your can focus mainly on front-end functionality
    * In both cases: Realtime is baked in
    * In some cases even HTML templating will be baked in
    * and those templates will auto-updated when you update data structures
    * Will "Realtime" simply become an expected piece of functionality in the same way we expect to be able to persist data?
    
    ---
    
    template: dblue
    
    ## 5 Realtime Framework Considerations
    
    1. Use an Existing Solution
    2. Use a language you're comfortable with
    3. Do you need native mobile support?
    4. onMessage, PubSub (Evented), RMI or DataSync
    5. Where in development?
